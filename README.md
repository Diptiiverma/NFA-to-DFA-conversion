#NFA to DFA Conversion in Python

This project implements a converter that transforms a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) ‚Äî including Œµ (epsilon) transitions ‚Äî into its equivalent Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using Python. This is a fundamental concept in automata theory, often used in the design of compilers and lexical analyzers.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This implementation considers Œµ-transitions only for epsilon closure calculation during the conversion process.
It does not support NFA transitions on epsilon as input symbols in the alphabet. That is, Œµ should not be provided as part of the input alphabet.

‚ú® Features
`Handles epsilon (Œµ) transitions for closure.
`Implements subset construction for conversion.
`Computes epsilon-closure of NFA states.
`Identifies final states in the resulting DFA.
`Clearly displays DFA transitions and structure.

üß† Code Overview
The NFAtoDFA class:
1._init__(): Initializes NFA components.
2.epsilon_closure(states): Finds all states reachable using Œµ-transitions.
3.move(states, symbol): Finds all states reachable on a specific symbol.
4.convert(): Uses epsilon closures and subset construction to build the DFA.
5.display_dfa(): Outputs all DFA states, transitions, and final states.
